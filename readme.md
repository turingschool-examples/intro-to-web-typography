### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will know/be able to:

* Have an understanding of the structure of letterforms
* Understand how to select font pairs
* Be a just a really huge nerd

### What is Typography

Typography is a cornerstone of graphic design. The way we arrange letters and words on a screen is a huge, often unappreciated, part of how we communicate with users. Design is all about people and communication, and the words we choose and how we arrange them are arguably even more important then the images and colors we use.

As with any craft, there is quite a bit that goes into successful typography that may not be apparent to the end user. People build entire careers around designing and building typefaces, and there is a lot more to a letterform than whether or not is has serifs.

### Font vs Typeface

You've probably heard these two terms tossed around and used interchangebly, but they're actually two different things. A font is not a typeface and a typeface is not a font.

### Anatomy of a Letterform

Perhaps unsurprisingly, there are many typographic terms that come in handy when discussing letters in any amount of detail. Let's go over a few key terms that can help you speak type.

##### Cap Height
The height of a capital letter measured from the baseline.

##### X-height
The height of lowercase letters from the baseline, typically based on the height of the lowercase "x". X-height does not include ascenders or descenders, and it is measured against the main body of the lowercase letter.

##### Baseline



##### Stem

##### Serif

##### Finial

#### Guided Practice (We do)

* instructor and students both "doing"
* Examples: code-along, hot seat, discussion, question/answer, students telling instructor what to write, students pairing with close guidance from instructor

#### Independent/Pair Practice (You do)

* students "doing", instructor available as lifeline
* Examples: questions in a Gist, implementing feature, creating diagram

#### The Closing: ~5 min

* Check for understanding
* Discuss any clarifications or student misconceptions
* Review goals, further resources, and next steps

### Possible questions and/or misunderstandings

* What questions might students ask during class, and how will you respond?
* What concepts might students misunderstand, and why?
